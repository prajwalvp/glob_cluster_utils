Short term
1. Script to input meta file, Baugmardt . Output is a plot with beams, core, half mass radius overlaid and respective beams that make the cut within these radii.
2. Follow up interesting candidates by getting neighbouring beams. Script to input beam number and output six closest neighbouring beams for refold.

Long term
3. Candidate viewer which takes bestprof and meta file as input. Also flexible for bestprof inputs alone. 
4. Retrain PICS with the classified candidates.
