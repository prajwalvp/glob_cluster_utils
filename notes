1. Add plot of overlaying core, half mass radii on the beams themselves along with variable overlap factor (Take tips from Federico's code and metaxtractor)
2. For follow up purposes, add a script that gives a set of neighbouring beams for a given beam and meta file. Also allow for finding closest beam from different meta file. 
3. Candidate viewer which takes bestprof and meta file as input. Also flexible for bestprof inputs alone.
